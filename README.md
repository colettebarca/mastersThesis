## Master’s Thesis: Detecting Potential College Dropouts Among High School Students
### Goal: Use anomaly detection techniques to create a holistic early detection tool that
indicates which high school students are most at risk to drop out of college. An individual’s high
school experience is not confined to the academic components. As such, an effective model
should incorporate both environmental and educational factors, including various descriptive
data on the student’s home area, the school’s area, and the school’s overall structure and
performance. This project combined this information with data on students throughout their
secondary educational careers (i.e., from ninth through twelfth grade) in an attempt to develop a
model that could detect during high school which students have a higher probability of dropping
out of college.
